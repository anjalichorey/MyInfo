        <p>To succeed in an industry marked by evolving regulations and rapidly expanding customer expectations, ABN AMRO has embraced cultural change within the company to sustain long-term innovation. One aspect of the cultural change taking place throughout ABN AMRO is the IT organizationâ€™s adoption of continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) practices. we have automated many manual steps in our processes, we as a team has more transparency and are able to find and fix issues in the early stages of a project. Since we are autonomous we are not dependent on any other team for deployments.</p>
